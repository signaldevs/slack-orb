  Send notifications from a CircleCI workflow to a Slack channel.

  The following environment variables are required to use this orb:
    - CIRCLE_API_TOKEN: used to retrieve the workflow name since slack does not provide one. See the CircleCI docs on
        how to generate a token, https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token
    - SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN: the OAuth token acquired through the setup guide, https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/slack-orb/wiki/Setup
    - SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL: a Slack channel ID to post to. You can easily obtain the Slack channel ID by right clicking,
        and copying a link to the channel. The ID will be visible at the end of the URL
  It is recommended to create a `slack` context with these env vars and use that context in your workflows.
  See these docs on how to do so, https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/#creating-and-using-a-context
